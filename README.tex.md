`CompositeRegressionEstimation` is an R package that allows to compute estimators for longitudinal survey:
* Composite Regression ["Fuller, Wayne A., and J. N. K. Rao. "A regression composite estimator with application to the Canadian Labour Force Survey." Survey Methodology 27.1 (2001): 45-52."](http://www.statcan.gc.ca/pub/12-001-x/2001001/article/5853-eng.pdf)
* Yansaneh Fuller
* AK estimator

#  General usage

## Install


```r
devtools::install_github("DanielBonnery/CompositeRegressionEstimation")
```
## Demonstration code
This package has been used for the paper submitted by D. Bonnery, P. Lahiri and Y. Cheng on real data (CPS data).
One can consult the pdf package documentation on the github page to see demo code.

Below is given a basic demonstration code on a simulated dataset


```r
library(CompositeRegressionEstimation)
data(CRE_data)
example(MR)
```

## Manual
R package pdf manual can be found there:

# Repeated surveys



The output of a repeated survey is in general a sequence of datasets, 
one dataset for each iteration of the survey. 

## An example: the US Census Bureau CPS survey.

### Variables

The CPS provides 8 different employment categories, but we can regroup some to get 3 categories: 
employed, not employed, not in the labor force.
Each dataset may contain variables that can be described by the same dictionnary, or there may be changes. 

### Rotation group and rotation pattern

The sampling units also usually differ from one dataset to the other, due to non response or due to a deliberate choice not to sample the same units.
Let $m\in\{1,\ldots,M\}$ be an index of the time, and let $S_m$ be the set of sampling units at time $m$. The samples $S_m$ are subsets of a larger population $U$.

Some repeated surveys use rotation groups and a rotation pattern.
For the CPS, each sampled household will be selected to be surveyed during 4 consecutive months,  then left alone 8 months, then
surveyed again 4 consecutive months. As a consequence, for a given month, a sampled units that month will be surveyed for the first, second, ..., or 8th and last time. This induces a partition of the sample into month-in-sample groups:
$S_m=S_{m,1}\cup S_{m,2}\cup \ldots\cup  S_{m,8}$. 


For each unit $k$ in $S_m$, usually the dataset contains:
the values $Y_{m,k}$ of a variable of interest $Y$ for unit $k$ and the period $m$.
It also contains $w_{m,k}$ a sampling weight.



#### Get the data
The R package `dataCPS` available there: ["github.com/DanielBonnery/dataCPS"](github.com/DanielBonnery/dataCPS) contains functions to download the CPS anonymised micro data from the U.S Census Bureau website.

The following code creates a list of dataframes for the months of 2005 that are selection of variables from the CPS public use microdata. It creates a new employment status table with only 3 levels
